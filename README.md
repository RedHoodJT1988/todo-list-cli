#todo-list-cli
This is a basic todo list application that can be used from within
your CLI. I used TypeScript to create this project from scratch. 
It uses Inquirer.js to handle the commands from within the terminal.
This was a practice application to better understand the inner workings
of how TypeScript works. Enjoy!
